Using BERT embeddings with c-TF-IDF for topic moddeling

## Getting started
Getting embeddings, tokenizing and lemmatizing large chunks of data takes a while and if you just 
want to see how it works you can download my preprossed [dataset of russian news](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vfomenko/russian-news-2020) here -> [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S5QGiTMdIQUvtX_4bN359wzmqtx6IxHj?usp=sharing).

## Visualisations
Visualization realized with plotly provides semi-interactive figures. You can play with it in the notebook above. Hovering over a point symbalizing one document shows its topic and id for deeper diging-in.
